## How to contribute?

Currently, this project is in the early stage of development and a lot of parts can be changed. So I don't think it's a good time to contribute to this project yet.

It doesn't mean that I don't accept contributions now, but I think it's better to wait until the project is more stable.

When it is ready, I will update this section. üôè
